# 🚗 Electric Vehicle Analysis & Forecasting Dashboard

This project combines **Machine Learning** and **Power BI** to deliver a predictive and interactive analysis of Electric Vehicle (EV) trends across the United States.

## 📌 Overview

As part of my internship at **Unilever**, I developed this comprehensive dashboard to:
- Visualize historical electric vehicle registrations
- Predict growth from **2025 to 2030** using ML models
- Explore state-wise trends and eligibility programs like **CAFV**

---

## ⚡ Key KPIs in Dashboard

- **Total Vehicles:** 150K
- **BEV Share:** 117K (78%)
- **PHEV Share:** 34K (22%)
- **Average EV Range:** 126.40 Miles
- **Top Manufacturers:** Tesla, Nissan, Chevrolet, Ford
- **Top Models:** Model Y, Model 3, LEAF, Bolt EV
- **State-wise Vehicle Heatmap**
- **CAFV Eligibility Breakdown**
- **Model Year Growth Trends**

## 🔬 Predictive Analysis

The model used:
- TensorFlow/Keras with Dense and Conv1D layers
- Forecasted EV counts by year (2025–2030)
- Evaluation metrics: MAE, MSE, R²
- Preprocessing steps included signal parsing, dropout layers, and early stopping for tuning

---

## 📊 Tools Used

- **Power BI** (for dashboard creation)
- **Python** (TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Model training and prediction)
- **CSV Dataset** (Public EV registry & emissions eligibility data)
